    <h2> Website goal</h2>
        <p> What I hope to end gain from creating this website is to show my peers and anyone who wishes to view it an introduction or remembrance of a genre that means an incredible amount to me. This is the music I've been listening to my entire life (literally), and I really want to share how the cadence, sound, lyricism, and overall feel of this decade is so unique and special. I hope for them to save my playlist to their accounts if they have Spotify, or even just add a song or two to their own playlists. I also hope that it can spark discussion on the differences between modern-day music and its variety, and the almost overwhelming monotonism of the 80s sound.

    <h3>Information and Resources</h3>
    <p> What I Will Need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Text</b>: For text, I'll be utilizing the Google fonts that Professor Moore taught us to input into our code. I hope to find a few 80s-looking ones for my headers, something real crazy and eye-catching without being atrocious to look out!</li>
        <li> <b>Graphics</b>: I'll be finding a few from free photo websites like Pixabay and Vecteezy, which looks to be the msot helpful in finding some good graphics. I don't want too many, just enough to introduce the 80's genre/sounds and some iconci artists.</li>
        <li> <b>Sounds</b>: I've made a playlist with my (biased) favorite 80's songs so that the viewer can also get an audible experiences while looking at the website. I'll be utilizing a couple articles I found that help one put Spotify links in a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-09-04/how-to-embed-spotifys-play-button/">website</a></li>
        <li> <b>Outside Resources for the Viewer</b>: I'll be embedding or at least including articles for others if they find this information helpful or entertaining and want to learn more. I'm only going to put a few, and have them in a nav link that's either last or close to last.</li>
