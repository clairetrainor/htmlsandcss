  <p> This is my personal playlist of my favorite 80s songs. Underneath is one of Spotify's Curated Playlists that I also enjoy. Give them a listen, I'm positive you'll find some new songs to love!</p>

  <p> Well, what did you think? It's never right to force someone's taste onto another, but I sincerely hope by traveling through time and space with me, you can see why I'm so attached to the genre. If you found that a particular type of song appealed to you, it may be a sub-category of the genre, where you can learn more about on <a href="thesound.html">The Sound</a>. Happy listening!</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Why Do I Love 80s Music So Much?</h3>
    <p> Most babies are lulled to sleep by the soothing notes of Mozart, Chopin, or Bach. I, however, found myself falling asleep to the sweet sounds of various iconic 80s artists. Not only was it there as I was asleep, but in the waking hours I spent riding in my father's old sedan as he popped in casette after cassette into the player, and explained each song and why it made it onto his very selective playlist. Weekend evenings we were allowed to pull out the ABBA CD Collection, filled with their various hits and accompanying music videos. I found myself gravitating towards 'Waterloo', 'Super Trouper', and 'Chiqitita,' with their infectious sound and a rthym that even someone with two left feet- like me- could dance to. This consistent interaction with the genre helped shape my entire musical awareness and molded me into who I am today.</p>
  
    <p> When it comes to how much music influences someone's life and personality, I believe it varies from person to person. Someone who constantly listens to sad music may, in fact, feel sad because of it, someone who listens to classical may have less anxiety than others, and some who listen to rap may have better lyricism and audio processing skills because of it. I believe for me, listening to the 80s without experiencing the decade made me long for certain parts of a timeline I won't be able to access. When Bruce Springsteen talks about the 'Summer of 69,' I find myself yearning for boyhood with its friendships and ties, the exploration of anything and everything, the pranks and clowning, and the freedom of it all. When I sing along to Pat Benetar's 'Love is A Battlefield', I'm now a whimsical, love-stricken teen who only wants to be with her partner, despite her parents' disapproval- a classic cinematic tension I have luckily not partaken in. In Michael Jackson's 'Chicago', I've mistakenly been strung along by this beautiful woman's lies, pages, and suave dances moves, only to discover the truth too late! All of these instances are presumedly fictional but had the possibility of being true in that time period. And while there is melancholy in that, I also believe it's a good thing- to be able to romanticize it. As most of us are well aware, the 80s wasn't a decade of exclusive happiness, with tragedy and hardship being experienced as much as it is today. Therefore, looking back at this music with both a critical and nostalgic lense is important in order to fully understand and enjoy it.</p>
