<div id="wham">
    <h3>Wham!</h3>
    <p>The creators of possibly one of the most iconic Christmas songs, "Last Christmas," Wham! was a pop duo made up of singers George Michael and Andy Ridgley. A few of their hits include the aftermention holliday jam, as well as "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and "Everything She Wants"- my personal favorite. Everything She Wants tells a story in such a devastatingly accurate way, while still produced a beat, rthymn, and tune that makes you want to get up and move. George sings about how the love he had for his partner is now gone due to her innabilty for satisfaction in any part of the relationship- no matter what milestones they hits or how much he tries to please her. His lyrics are a confessional of hopelessness while us, the listener, can do nothing but take in what he is saying. A tragic and beautiful bop!</p>

<div id="collins">
    <h3>Phil Collins</h3>
    <p> Creator of the hits of the beloved movie "Tarzan," Phil Collins is almost entirely known from this one movie that most people my age have seen. But once discovering his discography, it's almost impossible to get rid of his voice- which I can only describe as heart-stringing and suave. A favorite of mine from his many, many listens is "Easy Lover," a collaboration with Phillip Bailey. It tells of a woman whose moves are so good she can get any man to fall for her, yet never attach or develop feelings herself. I like to think of this imaginary woman as a "girlboss" of sorts, able to play the field to get through life- I commend that! You go Glenn Coco, you go!</p>

<div id="depechemode">
    <h3>Depeche Mode</h3>
    <p> I like to think of Depeche Mode as the 'edgy' group of the bunch. Within the 80s genre, subgenres like New Wave exist (I talk about this on my <a href="thesound.html"> The Sound</a> page) in which Depeche Mode is a heavy contributor. Dressed head-to-toe in alternative gear, smeared with eyeliner and a sad face, these lovely boys sing about, well, love! Not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm of the opinion that the greats were all seen as kooky or weird at one point, and what is the point of societal rules about appearance if not to break them! My favorite of their songs- and my most played song of this year on my Spotify Wrapped- is "Enjoy the Silence." This speaks to the idea of "actions speak louder than words," where the singer explains how he can express his love to his partnere without needing the complication of words to misinterpret how he feels towards them. It's truly a romantic and lovely song.</p>

<div id="michael">
    <h3>Michael Jackson</h3>
    <p>The King of Pop, a model of the genre in its own, a true rulebreaker and standard-maker. Michael Jackson is known to everyone in one way or another. My dad didn't have a lot of his cassete, therefore he wasn't played as often as other creators, so a lot of Jackson's works I discovered on my own. Although his overall genre is pop (hence his title), he was able to morph the rules of it to accomodate his desires. Take for example, "Love Never Felt So Good" and "Earth Song," both by the King of Pop, yet both so drastically different. My personal favorite of his is "P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)," it's one of his happiest with an upbeat tempo, catchy chorus, and such a 'dance-able' melody. His life was beautiful and thrilling in so many ways, and he became adored and beloved to so many. His legacy on the world, not only in music but in him as a person, will live on.</p>

<div id="idol">
    <h3>Billy Idol</h3>
    <p>I classify Billy Idol as the "bad boy" of the group. This British pop-punk icon is known for his hard-hitting beats and loud, untamed lyrics. His spiky, bleach-blond hair and leather jacket gives off no indication that he's to be played with, and America loved his hits like "Dancing With Myself" and "Eyes Without A Face." Later songs, like "Rebel Yell," Idol unabashedly talked about sex and love, which I believe only helped his fame within the punk and pop communities alike. The beats and tempo made them catchy while the lyrics were just enough of that chaos that the alternative and punk communities were looking for. My favorite of his are "Rebel Yell" and "White Wedding: Part 1," both equally loud and abrasive and fantastic if you're in the mood kick and flail around! </p>

<div id="bowie">
    <h3>David Bowie</h3>
    <p>Another iconic artist, Bowie got his start in the 70s alongside other rule-breakers like Michael Jackson and Elton John. His androgynous style and application of makeup to create his persona, Ziggy Stardust, made him unique and refreshing to the youth of England. His popularity only continued a decade later, and traveled to the United States, where hits like "Modern Love" and "Let's Dance" gained prominence. My personal favorite of his is "Rebel Rebel," where he pays a nod at the parents of the time who were not appreciative of his gender-less influence on their children in the lyrics "You got your mother in a whirl, she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl." It's fantastic, no?</p>
