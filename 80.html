        <h3> Why In the World Should I Care About the 80s?</h3>
        <p>What made the 80s such an explosive and defining decade for music? As someone who in no way is a music genius themselves, it's difficult to define the exact points that creates the harmonic and tonic rythms, beats, and melodies that grace our ears. Nevertheless, the consistent presence of certain attributes to many songs stand out, and help a novice such as myself understand just why and how the 80s have proved itself to be a timeless music genre.</p>
        <p> My Dad always likes to say that I was born in the wrong generation, and although I wholeheartedly disagree, I understand what he means. It's hard to find another person my age who consistently listens to the 80's sound, many iconic songs are recognized here and there- Take on Me, Never Gonna Give You Up, literally any Michael Jackson song- but the love for it has been lost among people my age. Through this website and its exploration, I hope that the user- yes YOU- can find or rediscover the art of the 80s sound, pick up a new song or two, or listen to an artist you knew nothing about before this. Thank you for visiting a place that is very special to me, enjoy!</P>
