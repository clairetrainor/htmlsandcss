    <h2>Questions 1-5</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The purpose of my website is to introduce my favorite genre of music to my fellow classmates, or anyone who clicks on my website. I hope to spread the unique and sensational sounds of the 1980's through articles, links to playlists, spotify widgets, bright colors, and information on why this spdcific decade sounds so different.</li>
            <li>I want my website to help at least one person discover new music, which I believe is always a good thing. It broadens horizons through sound, something words cannot quite get across.</li>
            <li>My intended audience is people aorund my age, the younger generation. Because I'm trying to introduce peole to this genre, older generations will likely know the specific songs and bands I'm tlaking about, and are less likely to further explore my links and resources.</li>
            <li>The content I am going to include are article quotes to corroborate my personal feelings for specific songs, with spotify widgets of the songs attached on the page- letting the user both listen to the song/artist while reading about them. I am also going to "trick out" my website to look fairly 80s-esque, I want to retro/robot-y looking space-age feel to it, like being transported to a different decade.</li>
            <li>My website's content will be unqiue because of the user-interface. Allowing the user to access music on the page wil increase interaction with the page and encourage users to explore further.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Question 6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/"> Spotify has both a great webpage layout and look as well as a good content set-up. I hope to utilize how their "player" is used- at a much more beginner level.</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/daytrotter#!/"> Paste's website's layout is absolutely adorable, I love the sketches of the artists. The content I'm not much interested in, as the artists are modern-day artists.</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/"> Apple Music has a fantastic design, the flow is gorgeous and fluid.</a></li>
