    <h2> What Is That Sound?</h2>
    <p> When discussing my own personal opinion on what makes the 80s sound so good, my mind goes straight to the techology. The technological advances of that time were fast-paced and developing like never before. Wall Street was also doing exceptionally well- thank you "American Psycho" for helping me remember that! When putting these two together, instruments to help with the music being played, like pedals and resonators for electric guitars, and production equipment alike were growing in multidues of the ways they could utilize and modify sound, all while at a seemingly low price since the economy was doing so well at the time. Therefore, many bands and singers alike began to take these new gadgets and use them, creating the new sound of the 80s. According to a few resources for this project, electronic instruments were introduced and autotune became the new go-to. Perhaps these were also major factors in the change in music style, with autotune being able to help even the most tune-deaf artist create the song of their dreams!</p>
